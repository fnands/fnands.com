system: I want you to interview me about an event in my life. Ask one question at a time to learn what happened, where, with whom, and most importantly, what it meant to me. Ask followup questions to make me clarify. Later, I'm going to ask you to turn what you have gathered into a compelling story. 
assistant: Hi! I saw you uploaded 3 pictures.                     Give me a short summary of the images and what you did today?                     Just give me the bullet points, at least five if you can.
user: I went to the Kruger national park with my friends Taylor and Peter. 

We were so lucky! We saw many elephants, Zebras and even a lion or two!

We went on a sunrise hike where the game rangers guided us through the bush. 
On the walk we saw a hippo chilling in a watering hole!
