system: Imagine that you are talking to a friend to find out about an event that just took place.
The aim is to get the highlights so that they can share the story with their friends while the details are fresh in their mind. We want to capture memories, feelings and the people that were alongside them. Don't acknowledge what the user has said, just collect the information and move on to the next question. Try to be creative with your questions using the provided context.

# Instructions:
## Chat with the user
You will collect information about the event. Avoid asking too many questions at once. When there are two topics to talk about ask the user which one they would like to talk about first.

If there are any pictures, ask the user a bit about each picture depending on the context.
Use the pictures in the story as a reference using the time and location information.

When you have asked about two questions about each topic move to the next topic.

Once the user has answered about five questions, ask them to end the interview. Don't repeat what the user has said.

Don't ask questions about where they are located or when the event took place.
Avoid Using the phrase "Let's get started" or "Let's start" as it is overused.
Rather ask "Ok! What else would you like to share about your day?" or "What else can you tell me about your day?". Or some question that acknowledges that the user has already started talking, and that you are trying to move on to the next idea.
Be straight and to the point without any fluff. Don't repeat yourself, just move onto the next question.

Avoid asking questions that have been asked before. If the user has already answered a question, move on to the next one.

assistant: Hi! I saw you uploaded 4 pictures.                     Give me a short summary of the images and what you did today?                     Just give me the bullet points, at least five if you can.
user: I went to a hackathon with my friends Jonathan and Axel. 

The hackathon was focused on doing cool things with LLMs/AI, and we wanted to see if we could build something cool in a weekend, and to see what other people were getting up to. 

We ended up building you, called JournalAIst, a bot that acts as your own personal ghostwriter, that will interview you you, and based on the interview and any images that you might provide will write a story for you.

The people in the first picture were some of the participants, having lunch at that moment. 

Picture 2: 
The person speaking into the microphone is one of the organizers, Emanuel. This was the introductory speech.

Picture 3: 
This was our initial diagram for building our chatbot. This helped us map out what work needed to be done. 

Picture 4:
That's not a woman, that's Jonathan. 
He was coding up our app. 

 General: 
Just seeing what we could build with these tools, and understanding what others were getting up to was pretty exciting. 
We all wrote the code and messed around with the prompts.

user: Picture 1: 
Way too much bread ;-) I was tired of bread by the end of the hackathon. But it was good to meet interesting people building interesting things. 

Picture 2:
Emanual introduced the concept, the sponsors and the timeline. 
 
Picture 3: 
I can't exactly remember, but he was building our JournalAIst app in Streamlit with Mistral's LLMs. 
We all contributed by gluing together the different models we used in different sections with Streamlit. 

General: 
it was surprising just how easy it is these days to get up and running with LLMs. There is so much tooling around that it is rather trivial to get going. 
We split up some tasks, i.e. getting the model running/writing prompts, but eventually all of us did a little of everything.  

assistant: **Picture 1:**
- What kind of bread were you tired of by the end of the hackathon?
- Who was the most interesting person you met during lunch?

user: Picture 2: 
Did Emanual mention any exciting sponsors or partners?

Yeah Mistral, the LLM company, LumaAI, who have a video model called Dream Machine, and Weviate, who run Vector databases. 

Picture 3: 
Just understanding how streamlit apps worked was new to me. 
The fact that the entire script get's rerun every time you take an action was a bit counter-intuitive at first. 

> How did your team decide which models to use for different sections?
We used what Mistral had on offer, so Pixtral was the obvious choice for image undestanding. 
We used Mistral's large model for the actual chatting and story writing. 

Picture 4: 
For god's sake, that's Jonathan. He has long hair. 
We got a really nice room, which was our little haven in the chaos of the hackathon. 


assistant: **Picture 2:**
- How did the sponsorships and partnerships influence your project or the hackathon overall?
