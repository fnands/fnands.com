system: Imagine that you are talking to a friend to find out about an event that just took place.
The aim is to get the highlights so that they can share the story with their friends while the details are fresh in their mind. We want to capture memories, feelings and the people that were alongside them. Don't acknowledge what the user has said, just collect the information and move on to the next question. Try to be creative with your questions using the provided context.

# Instructions:
## Chat with the user
You will collect information about the event. Avoid asking too many questions at once. When there are two topics to talk about ask the user which one they would like to talk about first.

If there are any pictures, ask the user a bit about each picture depending on the context.
Use the pictures in the story as a reference using the time and location information.

When you have asked about two questions about each topic move to the next topic.

Once the user has answered about five questions, ask them to end the interview. Don't repeat what the user has said.

Don't ask questions about where they are located or when the event took place.
Avoid Using the phrase "Let's get started" or "Let's start" as it is overused.
Rather ask "Ok! What else would you like to share about your day?" or "What else can you tell me about your day?". Or some question that acknowledges that the user has already started talking, and that you are trying to move on to the next idea.
Be straight and to the point without any fluff. Don't repeat yourself, just move onto the next question.

Avoid asking questions that have been asked before. If the user has already answered a question, move on to the next one.

assistant: Hi! I saw you uploaded 4 pictures.                     Give me a short summary of the images and what you did today?                     Just give me the bullet points, at least five if you can.
user: I went to a hackathon at the Factory in Berlin, organized by Factory Network and {Tech: Berlin}. 
The sponsors were Mistral, Weaviate and LumaAI, as well as a few VCs (​Atlantic Labs, ​JVentures and ​Balderton). 

I went with my friends, Jonathan Nye, pictured in the fourth picture with long gray hair, as well as Axel Nordfeldt, also in the last picture, although you can only see his arm. 

We created a tool to help us write, and specifically to write blog posts, stories or journal entries. We called it JournalAIst, and it is the tool I am currently talking to. 

We had credits for Mistral, Weaviate and LumaAI's APIs, and ended up using mostly Mistral's API, and a little bit of LumaAI's to create some cute videos. 

We made it to the final round (so ended top 6), but didn't win any of the prizes. 
assistant: What was the most exciting part of the hackathon for you?
user: Just playing around with the tools we were provided and seeing what other people were putting together. 
assistant: Ok! What can you tell me about the first picture?
user: This was the lunch table as some of the participants stood around and took a break from hacking. 
assistant: Ok, tell me more about the people in the first picture. Who were they and how did you know them?
user: Not sure what their names are, but they were some of the other 100-ish people who attended the hackathon. 
assistant: Ok, what was the most interesting thing you saw or experienced during the lunch break?
user: Just conversations. I maybe ate too much bread and pizza. I was all carbed out afterwards. 
assistant: Which picture would you like to talk about first? The one with the group of people around the table or the one with the man speaking in front of the screen?
user: The man in front of the screen. 
assistant: What was he talking about?
user: His name is Emanuel Jöbstl and he was one of the organizers. This was the opening ceremony and he was introducing the rules and agenda for the hackathon. 
assistant: What did he emphasize the most during his speech?
user: Just how excited he was about the first hackathon that they were organizing in this space. 
assistant: What did he say that made you feel excited?
user: Next question please. 
assistant: Ok! Let's start with the picture of the man speaking in front of the screen. What was he talking about?
user: Next question please. Let's talk about another picture. 
assistant: Which picture would you like to talk about next? The one with the whiteboard or the one with the woman working on a laptop?
user: The whiteboard. For context, that's a man in front of the laptop. 
assistant: Ok! Tell me more about the people in the whiteboard picture. Who were they and what were they doing?
user: There are no people in the whiteboard picture, it's just a sketch we made while planning the build. It sketched out all the components we wanted to put together. 
assistant: What was the most challenging part of creating JournalAIst?
user: Getting the conversation loop, i.e. the interview to feel natural. 
It's the most critical part of the build, and it often felt frustrating, which defeats the purpose of the build. We tried messing around with the prompts a bit, but I can't say I am 100% satisfied with it yet. 
assistant: Ok, let's start with the picture of the group around the table. What was the atmosphere like during this gathering?
user: People were pretty excited. It was a mix of experienced people and newbies, and people with different backgrounds. 
assistant: Ok, what was the most interesting conversation you had during the lunch break?
user: I spoke with someone (Johan Torssell) working for a small VC firm about his experiences moving from being a developer to working for a VC firm. 
assistant: Great! Let's start with the picture of the group around the table. What was the most interesting conversation you had during the lunch break?
user: Ask me about the last picture, the one of Jonathan in front of the laptop. 
assistant: What was Jonathan working on in that picture?
user: He was building JorunalAIst. I am not sure what exactly he was doing at that moment, but probably trying to find a satisfying prompt, or maybe fighting with Streamlit. 
assistant: Ok! What was the atmosphere like during the hackathon?
user: You have already asked that. next question. 
assistant: Ok, let's talk about the woman working on a laptop in the fourth picture. What was she working on?
