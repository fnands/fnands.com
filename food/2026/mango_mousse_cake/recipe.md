## Directions

### Day 1

#### 1. Make the Cake Layer

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Line an 8-inch cake tin with baking paper (do not grease).
2. In a large bowl, whip egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add 60 g sugar for the whites, whipping until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, whip egg yolks with the other 60 g sugar and vanilla until pale and increased in volume (2–3 minutes).
4. Whisk in the oil and cold water. Add flour, baking powder, and salt; mix until you have a smooth batter.
5. Gently fold in half the whipped egg whites, then the remainder, folding until fully incorporated.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Bake for 45–50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Immediately after baking, invert the cake (still in the tin) onto a wire rack. Allow to cool completely upside down.

#### 2. Make the Mango Mousse

1. In a small bowl, combine gelatin powder and 2 tablespoons cold water. Mix and set aside to bloom.
2. Puree the mango pieces in a food processor until smooth.
3. Transfer mango puree to a pot. Add 150 ml water and 120 g sugar. Stir and heat over medium heat until simmering.
4. Add the bloomed gelatin to the warm mango mixture; stir until dissolved.
5. Strain the mixture through a sieve. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
6. In a large bowl, whip the double cream with vanilla until firm peaks form.
7. Add the cooled mango mixture to the cream in thirds, whisking between each addition until smooth. Set aside.

#### 3. Assemble the Cake

1. Line an 8-inch springform tin (bottom and sides) with baking paper or acetate.
2. Remove the cooled cake layer from its tin. Trim the top for an even surface.
3. Place the cake layer into the prepared springform tin. Pour the mousse on top.
4. Chill in the fridge 1–2 hours, until the surface of the mousse is set.

#### 4. Make the Mango Jelly

1. In a small bowl, combine 4 g gelatin and 1 tablespoon cold water. Bloom.
2. Puree mango until smooth, then transfer to a pot. Add 100 ml water and 50 g sugar; stir to combine.
3. Heat until simmering. Add bloomed gelatin; stir until dissolved.
4. Strain the mixture and set aside to cool (let it sit while the mousse sets).
5. Once the mousse is set, gently pour the cooled jelly over the top and spread evenly.
6. Return cake to fridge and chill overnight.
